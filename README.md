# Cypress-E-commerce-Sample-Project

Sample test automation project written with Cypress using Page Object Model and Cypress Commands. As a reporter, I also added ```mochawesome report``` to get the final report after running all tests. Project  written for the site [automationpractice.com](http://automationpractice.com/) which is e-commerce website. It covers the complete online shopping workflow. So there is a lot of back and forth between server and client, lots of validations built into it to give a complete experience to practice the scenarios might find in real time projects.

I have created file with test cases and based on this I was writing my test automation scripts using Cypress.

The test cases are divided into the following categories: 
- Login&Register
- My Account
- Products 
- Product Buy Flow
- Home Page

In specific folder you can find all test cases for this project and example of report after running all tests.
